TODO:
Accounting with Operating Units
===============================
This module introduces the following features:
- Adds the Operating Unit in the account move line.
- Define an Inter-operating unit clearing account at
company level.
- When users create a journal entry with lines in different operating units,
at the time of posting the journal entry it automatically creates the
corresponding lines in the Inter-operating unit clearing account,
making each OU self-balancing.
- Introduces checks that prevent users from entering cross-operating unit
journal entries using different accounts.
